# TradeComposer v4.0.0 — Unified System

## Pillars
1) **Unified app**: Dashboard (profile, connections, integrations, billing), Composer (coins/tokens/memecoins), Gemini Task Center.
2) **Backend ready**: Partner API routes for users, connections, integrations, payments, composer.
3) **AI-first UI**: Orchestration buttons, PlanCards, Policy presets with org/user/session + cloud sync.
4) **Firebase finalized**: rules, indexes, hosting config, emulator ports.
5) **Payments**: crypto scaffold (Coinbase Commerce-compatible + manual webhook).
6) **Composer modes**: mode-aware Gemini prompts & flows.

## Next steps to go live
- Wire real exchange connections (CCXT + secure key vault).
- Plug Coinbase Commerce (or NOWPayments) and set webhook secrets.
- Harden API with Firestore persistence + auth middleware.
- Add wallet connect for manual on-chain payments.
